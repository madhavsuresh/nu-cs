This is the wiki of [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) at Northwestern University.

The wiki is created and maintained by [Computer Science PhD Advisory Council](http://cspac.cs.northwestern.edu/). The goal of the wiki is for collecting institutional knowledge about Northwestern University's Computer Science department, Technology and Social Behavior (TSB) program, and Learning Science and CS program. We encourage all PhD students, staffs, and faculty members to contribute! Please click on the [Wiki](https://github.com/nu-cspac/nu-cs-wiki/wiki) link to start editing!
